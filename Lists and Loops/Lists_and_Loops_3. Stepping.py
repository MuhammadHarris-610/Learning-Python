# Lists and Loops: Exercise 3 (Using stepping in generating lists)

# Program Description: Odd numbers' list
odd_numbers = list(range(1, 20, 2)) # Used the list function to generate the list data structure and the range function to fill in the values with odd numbers.
print(odd_numbers) # The syntax of 'range' function means this range(starting value inclusive, ending value exclusive, step)
